                        Gotcha! Within the first couple of seconds of landing on a website, users make a decision about whether
                        or not they like the site.

                        As consumer experience shifts digital, from shopping malls to online stores, websites have become the new symbolic storefronts.
                        If this analogy is true, then the first click is the new window display. As a case study for this topic, I will be analyzing the
                        pre-existing pitfalls of the website for a local Providence restaurant, <a href="https://chengdutasteonline.com"  target="_blank">Chengdu Taste</a>,
                        and redesigning it to be more user friendly. The redesign process will be entirely holistic, identifiying usability issues, adapting both lo
                        and hifi wireframes, and finally implementing a responsive design.

                        Identifying Usability Problems

                        For context, Chengdu Taste is a Chinese restaurant located in Providence,
                        Rhode Island that specializes in Sichuan cuisine.
                        Think red hot, chilli laced, numbing spice. As a student who attends Brown
                        University nearby, Chengdu Taste certainly has been
                        a valuable institution that has gotten me through some tough times!

                    <h3> Accessibility </h3>

                    <p>
                        On the accessibility end, utilizing  WebAIM WAVE, the Chengdu Taste website does not have any alternative text for its photos. Additionally, there are issues with certain text headers having low contrast with the chosen background color. While it may seem rather pedantic, the issues analyzed by WebAIM Wave demonstrate that Chengdu Tasteâ€™s website is not necessarily accessible to all potential users (i.e color-blind, hard of hearing), which is pre-emptively minimizing the market for Chengdu Taste.
